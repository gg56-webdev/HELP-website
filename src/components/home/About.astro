        Water-related disasters affect 90% of all disaster victims worldwide
      </h2>
      <p>
        Water is essential for life, yet it can also pose significant threats to
        our society. Over the past decade, weâ€™ve witnessed an increase in the
        frequency and severity of water-related disasters. These events,
        including floods, droughts, storm surges, and tsunamis, not only disrupt
        sustainable development but also trigger political, social, and economic
        turmoil in various nations.
