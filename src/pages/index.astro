            Water is essential for life, yet it can also pose significant
            threats to our society. Over the past decade, weâ€™ve witnessed an
            increase in the frequency and severity of water-related disasters.
            These events, including floods, droughts, storm surges, and
            tsunamis, not only disrupt sustainable development but also trigger
            political, social, and economic turmoil in various nations.
